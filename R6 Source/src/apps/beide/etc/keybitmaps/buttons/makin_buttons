to make the button icons:

Generate icons as attributes using IconWorld.  Yes it sucks.

Use attrtores to convert the attribute files to resource files.

Use mwdres to extract all the resources.

edit the .r file generated by mwdres so it will make a rsrc file
that has all the icon buttons as resources with whatever
icon ids and names are desired.

Use mwbres to put together the resource file.
