This directory contains a Chinese input method.  The initial code
for this was licensed from FIC.  FIC's code did not support in-line
input, and wasn't very polished, so this version is drastically
modified.

Two different input methods are supported by the code and the
dictionaries here: Cangjie and zhuyin.  More information about
these types of input methods can be found in the book "CJKV
Information Processing" by Ken Lunde, published by O'Reilly.

To install this input method you need to install the "chinese" add-on
in the /boot/home/config/add-ons/input_server/methods/ directory.

You will also need to install the cjdict, phdict, pydict, and
chinese.cfg files in /boot/home/config/settings/chinese-input/, and
you will need a font installed that contains the Chinese character
glyphs.

The file named chinese.cfg in this directory is the configuration
file for Traditional Chinese input.  Copying the file
chinese.cfg.simplified to
/boot/home/config/settings/chinese-input/chinese.cfg will configure
the input method for Simplified Chinese.
