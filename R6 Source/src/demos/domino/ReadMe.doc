1 - About Domino :

Domino rules :
- You put dominos on the board, one by one, always having identical neighboor
  figures. You need to be in contact with at least one of the previously put
  dominos.
- The board is 100x100 squares big, with a one square line reserved on the border.
- 7 horizontal bands and 7 vertical bands, 2 squares width, divide the board in 64
  areas. To put a domino on a band, you need to use only the figure associated
  with the band (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and Be from left to right and top to bottom).
- At the end, you can complete the board by putting any possible domino in any
  possible place.

In the demo, the computer is playing alone, and usually put approximatly 2600
dominos in 6 or 7 minuts. After that, you can use the keypad (2, 4 6, and 8) to
move through the board and look at the result.

You can switch to another workspace at any time (Domino is a full-screen app
using the GameKit), or quit by Alt-Q. If you switch to another workspace, the
demo will continue to put dominos at the same speed, without displaying anything.

A counter in the right bottom corner allows you to know how many dominos have
been put.

Thanks to Guillaume Desmaret for all the textures and the icon.


2 - About the GameKit :

The current version of the GameKit doesn't provide any specific support for input
device. You have to use View->GetKeys() to read the keyboard, and the standard
stuff to read the joystick. The mouse is not usable at all just now (except by some
nasty hack). That will be improve in future release.

If a game crash using the screen, there is usually no way to get the control of
the screen back (the switch is cooperative). In that case you can use the graphic
safety shortcut (LEFT ctrl-shift-alt + F12) to kill the current owner of the screen,
and get back to the app_server. It's not perfect, but it's really helpful.
