// NASM BeIDE add-on
// --------------------------------------------------------------

nasmPlugin supports use of The Netwide Assembler (NASM)
in a BeIDE project.
To use assembly in your project you need to do the following:

1. Install NASM (see http://www.web-sites.co.uk/nasm/)
2. Copy nasmPlugin to /boot/develop/BeIDE/plugins/Prefs_add_ons/
3. Create a link in /boot/develop/BeIDE/tools to your nasm tool.
   (Case is important, the link should be called "nasm".)
4. Create a new target in Project Settings.
	Extension:	asm
	Flags:		compile stage
	Tool Name:	nasm
5. Add your .asm file to your project.  NASM will be used to assemble
the file during the compile stage.

You can also use Project/Preprocess to preprocess the file or
Project/Disassemble to create a listing file.
