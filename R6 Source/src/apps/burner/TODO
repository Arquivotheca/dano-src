Burner TODO list: (in no particular order)

- a better way of selecting a device/showing available devices should be implemented.

- status of the selected device (disc in drive, size of disc, ready to burn, etc)
  should be shown in the lower left corner of the window.

- the project should be set to dirty when any of the attributes of a track change.

- Need some way to set default silent pregap between tracks, and on a track by track
  basis.  Perhaps a "silence before track" box in the text control panel?

- EditWidget needs to support changing the pre-gap

- current play position should be shown on edit widget

- support for multiple projects open at once should be fixed.

- preview should be disabled if no sound output is available

- a barber pole display (or something similar) should be shown when files are loading.

- start/end and fade in/fade out controls should move to an integer number of seconds.

- resource file should have an icon for Burner project files.

- the stop/skip/etc buttons should work better while the preview is paused.

- skip buttons need their own art.

- Projects specified on the command line should be loaded in BurnerApp::ArgvReceived().

- EditWidget should take fade in/out into account when constraining start/end.  Right
  now you can move the fade out control to before the start control by moving the start
  or end slider

- EditWidget should special case drawing of the brackets when the start and end are
  close to each other to avoid the weird glitches that happen now.

- EditWidget needs to respond to keyboard input

- EditWidget drawing glitches should be fixed.

- Loading a project that points to files that have moved should be fixed.  A file panel
  asking the user to find the missing file should be popped up.  Even nicer would be
  to start a query with the leaf name of the missing file and ask the user if any
  of the results are desired file, and then show the file panel if not.

- the list view focus row doesn't change when the selection changes programmatically,
  and that results in it looking weird -- to fix it there needs to be support in
  BColumnListView to either make the focus row  change after programmatically changing
  the selection, or more generally, support for setting the focus row.

- text entry boxes for start, end, etc, should perhaps be in MM:SS format?

- CDDrivers should live in add-ons, not compiled into the app.  We should publish
  the driver interface so other people can add support for different drives.

- Support for adding data tracks from raw devices needs to be implemented

- After all other items are done, the code should be grep'ped for XXX: comments
  to make sure nothing else is missing
