- don't reload image when applying to multiple workspaces (artificial workspace switch)
-async controls
-cache loaded images (requires node monitor)
- 'default' setting for a folder should remove attribute
- should the changed settings be reloaded at all?
- node monitor on folders and default folder, to load settings if they change? what to do if changes have been made and settings on disk change?
- load default folder settings when "default" is selected in normal folders, and show them
- node monitor for the visible image
