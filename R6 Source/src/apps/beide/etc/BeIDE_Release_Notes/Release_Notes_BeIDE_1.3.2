Metrowerks BeIDE Release Notes 
=============================================

Version:	1.3.2
Date:		6/27/97
Authors:	Brian Stern, Jon Watte, Mark Anderson
			Burton T. E. Miller, Bernie Estavillo 
=============================================

Greetings Be developers.  This is an update of the BeIDE release
versions found on the DR3 CodeWarrior for Be CD and the AA BEOS CD.
It has relatively few new features.  It does have a number of bug 
fixes and performance improvements over the releases on
our CD and the BeOS CD.

You may notice that Be has modified their folder layout and that BeIDE 
and the other Metrowerks products are now in /boot/apps/Metrowerks,
with the system headers and libraries living in /boot/develop.  Because
of this many of the access paths in your existing projects will be invalic.
BeIDE will update the access paths in existing projects when opening
them for the first time.  If you have problems with files not being found
or with BeIDE reporting access paths not being found please inspect your
access paths prefs panel closely.  Note that 'access path not found'
errors reported when BeIDE launches may refer to the New Project access
path settings or to a project that you have double-clicked.

============================
New Features
============================

*	Faster opening and saving of projects.

*	Faster searching for files.
		  
*	Includes MWBResPlugin, which didn't make it onto the CD.  (Only for the 
	version on the CW4BeCD.)

*	Stampsound plays in the about box.

*	Smart zoom behavior for text, project and message windows.

*	Printing is now enabled.

*	Correctly deals with circular symlinks in the access paths.

*	Double-clicking of non-text, non-executable files in the project will
	launch the preferred app for that file.  This is useful now for
	resource files created by FileTypes, and hopefully for IconWorld and others
	in the future.

*	Outline hiliting is implemented in text windows along with a grey hilite color.  
	You can have any hilite color you like, as long as it's grey.  The 
	ability to select a hilite color will appear in a future version.

*	Added code to sync the file system when saving both text and project files.
	This should stave off some reported problems of corrupted text files if the 
	OS crashes shortly after a build. 

==========================
Bugs Fixed
==========================

Some deadlocks on the windowlist semaphore have been fixed.  This problem
was noticed mostly on PowerMac and PowerComputing machines (i.e., uniprocessor
machines).  If you see this again please let us know and send a ps.

Fixed a problem with use of command-arrow keys in text windows.

Fixed a typo with the default paths {beide}/headers/libraries -> {beide}/libraries.

Fixed a bug where changes in the Linker prefs panels were ignored until the project
was closed and reopened.

Fixed a bug that caused 'duplicate code' link warnings for .h files in a project.

Fixed a crash seen after adding about a hundred files to a project.

Improved the mechanism for setting the icons for executables.  You should just
need to add a rsrc file to your project that has the correct resources built
by IconWorld and FileTypes.

Fixed a crashing bug in the find window seen sometimes when closing projects.

Fixed a number of problems related to the message window with many messages in it.
These fixes should also improve times of removing messages from the message window.

==========================
Known Limitations
==========================

It's possible that this may be fixed by the time you read this but there is a problem
with the apparent appearance of temp files in the same folder as project or text
files when those files are saved.  You may see files named something like mwtmp45 and
your project or text files will appear to disappear from their locations.  Closing
and reopening these folders in the Tracker restores the correct names for these files.
This is cosmetic only and there is no loss of data.
