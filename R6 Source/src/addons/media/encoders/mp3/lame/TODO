things to check for:  

   -lncurses
   -llibsndfile      (allow user to enable)

1.
Does stdin work when LAME is compiled to use libsndfile? 
(new version of libsndfile will support this - try this out)


2. 
LAME has problems with pure DC input.  i.e. a square wave with
a frequency well below 20Hz.  Not very important, but it should
be fixed.

3. 
Replace internal representation of PCM data to floating point
(instead of short int).  This will help filtering (which
has to convert back and forth) and allow lame to handle
other than 16 bit input.   Also, modify mpglib to output
floating point and have finaly quantization step a
easy-to-change module so it can output other than 16bit.

Merge GOGO's fast assembler routines.

It would be nice to save some information whilst encoding
a: wave -> mp3
	a RIFF/wave can contain LIST chunks with information
	about author, title, etc. 
	==> could go into TAG fields of resulting mp3
b: mp3 -> mp3
	==> we could copy the TAG directly
c: mp3 <-> ogg
	==> copy TAG info into oggs info field and vice versa
d: mp3 -> wave
	==> copy TAG into LIST chunk
