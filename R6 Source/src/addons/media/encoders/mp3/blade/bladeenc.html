<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>Short Description</font>
<p>BladeEnc is a program to generate MP3 files from WAV or AIFF sound files.
BladeEnc is available for most modern computer platforms, including Windows,
Linux, BeOS, UnixWare, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, OS/2 and many
more.
<p>BladeEnc is free software distributed under the LGPL license and the
sourcecode is available from my homepage for those who might be interested.
<p>Windows users will find that it looks like a DOS-program, but it is
in fact a true 32-bit Windows application that supports long filenames
etc. This textbased interface might be a bit harder for the beginner, but
makes it easy to make automated scripts (like BAT-files) to perform your
tasks and makes BladeEnc a doodle to port to all modern operating systems
except Mac. A large selection of graphical frontends are available from
my homepage for those who prefer to do their encoding just by moving and
clicking their mouse.
<p>On my homepage you can also find some more detailed information about
BladeEnc, including a FAQ (answers to Frequently Asked Questions), speed
comparisons with other encoders and information about the quality of MP3s
generated by BladeEnc.
<p>You can also go to the link section of <a href="http://bladeenc.cjb.net/">my
homepage</a> if you want some more information about MP3 in general or
needs an MP3 Player.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>Quick-Start Guide</font>
<p>If you just want to turn your WAV/AIFF-files into standard 128 kBit
stereo MP3 files, just drag and drop your files onto BladeEnc.exe (that
is the BladeEnc ICON and not the window that opens if you double click
it).
<p>Once started, BladeEnc will encode the files one by one until finished,
which is a process that can take several hours.
<p>BladeEnc can be stopped any time during the process by pressing CTRL-C
(all systems) or ESC (Windows &amp; OS/2 only).
<p>The resulting MP3-files are put in the same directory as their corresponding
WAV/AIFF-files.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>The More Advanced Users Guide</font>
<p>BladeEnc is despite its primitive appearance both powerful and easy
to use. It is a console application that takes its parameters from the
commandline.
<p>Any number of WAV/AIFF-files can be specified on the commandline and
you can even use wildcards to specify more than one file at the same time.
For example will the command "<tt>BladeEnc *.wav</tt>" compress all WAV-files
in the current directory. Long filenames are supported when entering them
on the commandline, but if they include space-characters you will have
to enclose the names with quotation-marks ( " ).
<p>Switches can be entered on the commandline together with the filenames.
In earlier versions of BladeEnc it didn't matter where you put the switches
since they always affected all files anyway, but from BladeEnc 0.80 this
has changed in order to give you more flexibility.
<p>You can get a list of all valid arguments by running BladeEnc without
any commandline arguments (for example by double-clicking on its icon).
<p>If you feel that you need a temporary performance boost to your system
you can pause the process by pressing ESC (Windows &amp; OS/2) or CTRL-Z
(Linux and other UNICES).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>The Structure of The Commandline Arguments</font>
<p>The way the commandline is interpreted by BladeEnc has changed in version
0.80 in order to make it all more flexible and powerful and should work
nicely with most older frontends. Also, the l3enc emulation mode has been
removed, so it doesn't distinguish between l3enc- and BladeEnc commandlines
anymore, but should be able to understand both anyway.
<p>On the commandline you specify the files you want to encode, together
with any switches to control the process and optionally the name of the
output files. Most switches can be applied both globaly, which makes them
affect all the files, or localy, which makes them affect only one file.
<br>Switches that only affects the general behaviour of BladeEnc and don't
affect the output of the encoding process, can only be specified globaly
(like -quiet).
<p>The commandline is read by BladeEnc following these simple rules:
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
Files to be encoded are specified on the commandline.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>Example:&nbsp;</i><b><tt> bladeenc track1.wav track2.wav</tt></b><i>
will first encode the file track1.wav and then track2.wav.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
If an input file is immediatelly followed by a filename ending with ".mp3"
that will be the output name of the encoded file. If it isn't followed
by a filename ending with ".mp3", the output file will get the same name
as the input file, but substituting the extension with ".mp3".</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>Example:&nbsp; </i><b><tt>bladeenc track1.wav track2.wav output2.mp3</tt></b><i>
will first encode track1.wav into track1.mp3 and then encode track2.wav
into output2.mp3.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Switches that are placed before the first input file are considered global
and will affect all the specified files.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>Example:&nbsp;</i><b><tt> bladeenc -crc -160 track1.wav track2.wav
</tt></b><i>will
generate 160 kBit MP3 files with checksums of both input files.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Switches that are placed anywhere else will only affect the preceding input
file.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>Example:&nbsp;</i><b><tt> bladeenc track1.wav -crc -160 track2.wav
-mono
</tt></b><i>will generate a 160 kBit MP3 file with embedded checksum
of track1.wav and a 128 kBit mono MP3 file of track2.wav (128 kBit is the
default bitrate).</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Local switches have higher priority than global switches.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>Example:&nbsp;</i><b><tt> bladeenc -160 track1.wav -256 track2.wav</tt></b><i>
will generate a 256 kBit mp3 file of track1.wav and a 160 kBit mp3 file
of track2.wav.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Local switches must be placed after any specified output file. They may
not be placed between the input and output file.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>Example:&nbsp;</i><b><tt> bladeenc track1.wav output1.mp3 -256</tt></b><i>
will work just fine, but</i><b><tt> bladeenc track1.wav -256 output1.mp3
</tt></b><i>will
just confuse bladeenc and generate an error message.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Stdin can be specified as input by simply substituting the name of the
input file with <b>stdin</b>. This will make bladeenc read the input from
a redirection or pipe instead.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>Example: </i><b><tt>bladeenc stdin output.mp3 </tt></b><i>will encode
the file coming through stdin and put the result in output.mp3.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Stdout can be specified as output by simply substituting the name of the
output file with <b>stdout</b>. This will make bladeenc send the&nbsp;
generated MP3 file through the standard output stream.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>Example:</i>&nbsp;<b><tt> bladeenc track1.wav stdout </tt></b><i>will
encode track1.wav and send the mp3 file through the standard output stream.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
And all this can be combined into one big operation.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Example: <b><tt>bladeenc -160 track1.wav stdout -mono track2.wav track3.wav
output.mp3 -crc stdin stdout -112 </tt></b><i>will do all the following:
Encode track1.wav into a 160 kBit mono mp3 that is sent to stdout. Encode
track2.wav into a 160 kBit mp3 named track2.mp3. Encode track3.wav into
a 160 kBit mp3 with CRC named output.mp3. Encode what comes through the
stdin into a 112 kBit mp3 that is appended to the data that is allready
sent to stdout.</i></ol>

<p><br><font size=+2>Commandline Switches</font>
<p>All commandline switches are case-insensitive, so you can enter them
in either upper- or lower-case.
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=8 >
<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-[bitrate],
<br>-br [bitrate]</td>

<td>Defines the bitrate for the MP3-file. Higher bitrates gives better
quality, but also bigger files. Most people prefer to generate 128 kBit
MP3s. Please note that it's the total bitrate that is specified, so if
you're generating a stereo MP3-file at 128 kBit you get 64 kBit for left
channel and 64 kBit for the right channel. The default setting is 128 kBit
for stereo files and 64 kBit for mono files.&nbsp;
<p>Allowed bitrates are: 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 160, 192,
224, 256 and 320.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-crc</td>

<td>Adds checksum data to each frame in the MP3 file. The checksum data
is needed for error-correction when streaming the MP3 in realtime over
internet (as done by internet radiostations). It lowers the quality of
the sound slightly since the checksum data also needs to fit in the specified
bitrate and is not needed for normal use.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-delete,
<br>-del</td>

<td>The WAV-file is automatically deleted after having been encoded. Be
careful with this switch because the WAV-file is deleted even if the encoding
process failed (for example due to insufficient drivespace).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-mono,
<br>-dm</td>

<td>Downmixes stereo input files to mono before they are compressed, thus
generating mono MP3 files. This switch does nothing if the input file allready
is mono.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-leftmono,
<br>-lm</td>

<td>Takes only the left channel of the input file and encodes it into a
mono MP3. If the input file is mono it will be compressed as it is.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-rightmono,
<br>-rm</td>

<td>Takes only the right channel of the input file and encodes it into
a mono MP3. If the input file is mono it will be compressed as it is.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-swap</td>

<td>Swaps the left and right channels of stereo input files before encoding
them.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-private,
<br>-p</td>

<td>Sets the private-flag in the MP3-file, specifying that this is a private
MP3. As far as I know there is no program that treats private MP3's differently
from normal ones so it is practically useless.&nbsp;
<p>Setting this flag doesn't affect the encoding time, filesize or quality
in any way, so set it if it makes you happy.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP>-copyright,
<br>-c</td>

<td>Sets the copyright-flag in the MP3-file, specifying that this is a
copyrighted MP3. As far as I know there is no program that treats copyrighted
MP3's differently from normal ones so it is practically useless.&nbsp;
<p>Setting this flag doesn't affect the encoding time, filesize or quality
in any way, so set it if it makes you happy.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-copy</td>

<td>This switch clears the MP3 file's original-flag that is set by default
from version 0.50 of BladeEnc.&nbsp;
<p>Clearing the original-flag doesn't affect the encoding time, filesize
or quality in any way, so do it if it makes you happy.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-quiet</td>

<td>Prevents BladeEnc from doing any screen output, except for error messages.
This is mostly usefull if you want to run bladeenc as a background process
on UNIX systems. The screen output takes nearly no time at all, so you
won't even save 1% by disabling screen output.<b> This switch is global
only.</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-quit,
<br>-q</td>

<td>Makes BladeEnc quit automatically when all files have been encoded.
Normally BladeEnc waits for someone to press RETURN before quitting. <b>This
switch is global only.</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-outdir=[path]</td>

<td>Specifies an output path for the encoded files. Normally the MP3 files
ends up in the same directory as their corresonding WAV-files resides in,
but using this switch you can get them to end up wherever you like. <b>This
switch is global only.</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-prio=[setting]</td>

<td>Changes the task priority of BladeEnc. Valid settings are HIGHEST,
HIGHER, NORMAL, LOWER, LOWEST and IDLE. BladeEnc is by default set to LOWEST
priority which basically means that BladeEnc functions fine in the background
without disturbing or slowing down any other program. <b>This switch is
global only.</b>
<br><i>This setting is not available in all ports.</i></td>
</tr>

<p><font size=+2>L3Enc Emulation Mode</font>
<p>The l3enc emulation mode of older versions of BladeEnc has been removed
in BladeEnc 0.80 since the new way of reading the commandline in this version
makes it understand l3enc commandlines anyway.
<p>Just remember that the default bitrate of BladeEnc is 128 kBit, while
l3enc uses 112 kBit.
<p>However, two small tricks were necessary to make BladeEnc compatible
with l3enc:
<ol>
<li>
If the specified bitrate is over 1000 it is divided by 1000 in order to
convert it from bits/sec to kBit/sec.</li>

<li>
If l3enc's -hq switch is placed on the commandline or a bitrate over 1000
is specified locally using the -br switch, BladeEnc automatically activates
the -quit switch.</li>
</ol>
