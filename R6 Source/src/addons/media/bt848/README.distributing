The bt848 add-on can be distributed outside of Be, the driver cannot!
To make an archive that will build outside of Be, copy the entire bt848 add-on
folder somewhere, remove this file from the copy, rename the three makefile_dev
to makefile, and copy the SettingsHandler.h and TrackerSettings.h files from
src/inc/tracker_p into the bt848 add-on folder copy (or instruct the recipient
of the sourcecode to obtain these files from OpenTracker).
