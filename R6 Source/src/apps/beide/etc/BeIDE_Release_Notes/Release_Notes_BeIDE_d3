Metrowerks BeIDE Release Notes 
=============================================

Version:	d3
Date:		6/3/96
Author:		Brian Stern, Jon Watte, Mark Anderson
=============================================

Greetings Be developers.  This interim release of BeIDE for BeOS 1.1d7 
has several new features primarily related to the Find Window.

Please see the Be User Guide for more information on how to use BeIDE 
and also see the documentation files for the command line tools.

============================
New Features in This Version
============================

¥	Multifile Find - The Find window has been expanded and includes
	additional controls in the lower half that allow you to find and/or
	replace strings in multiple files. The triangle control at the 
	left of the window shows or hides these new controls.  The
	picture button at the left of the window, showing one or two 
	document icons, turns on or off multifile searching.  Controls related
	to multifile searching are disabled if multifile searching is off.
	
	If a project is open, turning on multifile searching will enable
	several checkboxes (Sources, System Headers, and Project Headers).  
	Checking one or more of these checkboxes will add the specified
	files to the list of files to be searched.  You may also search
	files that aren't in the project by dragging them into the file list
	or by using the other file panel that appears when the 'Others' button
	is clicked.

	You may cancel a multifile find in progress by hitting cmd-. while the 
	Find window is frontmost.

	You may save file sets for later use.  To save a file set add the files
	that you wish to the file list and choose 'Save this file set' from
	the file sets popup menu.  Enter a name in the window that appears,
	choose whether the file set should be available at all times (global) or
	only when this project is open (specific to this project), and hit
	'Save'.  The file set will then appear in the File Sets menu and
	choosing it will add those files to the file list.  To remove a file
	set, hold down option or control and choose the file set name from
	the File Sets menu.  The text 'Remove a File Set' will be enabled in
	the menu.

	The 'Stop at EOF' checkbox applies when doing a multifile 'find next'.
	With this option off finding proceeds as if all the files in the file
	list were one long file; if the find string isn't found in the file 
	searched, then the next (or previous) file will be searched.  With
	this option on searching will stop at the end of the file being searched.
	To proceed to the next file choose 'Search in Next File' from the Search
	menu in a source window.

¥	Reverse find menu items - If the shift key is held down while opening
	the Search menu in a source file the names of several of the menu items
	change so that they work in reverse.
	
	Find Next 				- Find Previous
	Find in Next File 		- Find in Previous File
	Enter Find String 		- Enter Replace String
	Find Selection			- Find Previous Selection
	Replace & Find			- Replace & Find Previous

¥	Tab and return keys in the Find Window - You may enter a tab character
	or return character in the Find or Replace strings boxes by holding
	down the option key at the same time.  You could always paste in
	these characters.
	
¥	Access paths - If a file is added to a project and that file
	isn't in any of the existing access paths an access path will be 
	automatically added to the project.  You should verify that this
	access path has the properties that you want.

¥	Type ahead selection of files in the project window - With the project
	window frontmost type the name of a file or group that is visible 
	in the window and it will be selected.

¥	Editor Add-ons - Support for add-ons that appear in an Add-ons menu in
	source windows and which can modify source files has been added.
	Add-ons are shared libraries that export a function of the following
	prototype:
	
	#pragma export on
	extern "C" {
        long perform_edit(BTextView *view);
	}
	#pragma export reset

	Editor add-ons must reside in a folder named '(Editor add-ons)' that
	is found in the same folder as BeIDE.
	
	See the Commenter Add-on sample project for an example of how to
	write an Editor add-on that adds or removes C++ style comments to
	selected lines of code.

¥	Can now access a number of commands that don't exist in the
	menus for various windows - Can open the Find window from the 
	Project window; can Make, Bring Up to Date, Link if the Find window
	or Message Window are in front; etc.

¥	Improved error reporting for errors occurring during finds using
	regular expressions.

¥	Cosmetic changes to the project window and several other windows.  

¥	Cancelling of compiles - Hitting cmd-. during a compile will cancel
	the compiles still waiting to start.  The info view will read 'Cancelling'
	until the compiles in progress are done.  (This feature exists in 
	version d2 but was inadvertently left out of the release notes.) 

==========================
Bugs Fixed in This Version
==========================

Find selection now works correctly.
Can now add source files to projects if the source files were opened
before the project.


================================
Known Bugs and Incompatibilities
================================

There is usually a pause when a project file is opened during which time
the response in the project window is slow.
