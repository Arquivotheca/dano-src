=============================================Metrowerks Be Native IDE Release Notes =============================================Version: d1Date:    12/22/95Author:  Brian Stern, Jon Watte=============================================Welcome to the first release of the Be native CodeWarrior IDE.  It isnot feature complete yet but it should get you up and going.  This summarywon't be a complete review but should point out those things you need toknow.¥ InstallationThe IDE and precompiled header file (BeHeaders) should be placed in /boot/be.  It is best if project files are not within the /boot/be tree.¥ Building a projectYou may add files to a project by dragging them onto the project window, bydragging folders onto a project window, or by using the add files dialog.  Youdo not need to add the library files libbe.so or libdll.a to your project.  Youwill get link errors if you do.Bring up to date - compiles all source files that need compiling.Link - links without compiling source filesMake - compiles all source files that need compiling and then linksRemove Objects - deletes all .o files from the Objects directory; all sourcefiles will need recompiling on the next Bring up to date or Make.Reset file paths - Certain information about source files and header files iscached.  This command will cause the project to refind all the files.  Usethis if you suspect that the IDE is finding the wrong file or seems not tobe able to find a file you know is in the project or system trees. ¥ Include File SearchingThe IDE uses the concepts of a system tree and a project tree.  The system treeis the folder that the IDE is in and all folders within that folder (typically/boot/be).  The project tree is the folder that the project file is in and all folders within that folder.  When searching for include files, files specifiedwith angle brackets will be searched for in the system tree only, files specified with quotes will be searched for first in the project tree and thenin the system tree if not already found.  The search order within these two trees is not defined.  If there is more than one include file with the same name it is not possible to predict which one will be found.  All file names are case sensitive.#include <stdio.h>  // search in system tree#include "MyView.h" // search in project tree first then system tree if not found¥ SettingsSettings can apply to the application defaults, to the current project, tothe message window, or to individual source windows.  <thesettings for the message window don't work yet>Most settings are obvious.  The application name is the name given to the built application <creator doesn't work yet>.The SYM file production doesn't work yet; link map does.Concurrent compiles - the IDE allows several compiler threads to be activeconcurrently.  I recommend that you use Pulse to determine the best setting for your machine.  The limiting factor seems to be available ram.  If the availableram drops to zero you start getting disk thrashing so drop the concurrentcompiles by one in this case.Prefix file - The file specified can be a text file or a precompiled headerfile.  The text file itself can include a precompiled header file.  The source for the BeHeaders precompiled header is simply:#include <Be.h>#include <StorageKit.h> In order to build a precompiled header file the source for this file mustbe part of a project.  Do the following:Create a text file that contains the source for your precompiled header, say"MyProjectHeaders.cpp".Add this file to a project.  With the file closed select it in the project window and choose precompilefrom the Project menu.  It will typically take a while for the precompile step to complete.  Once done,if there are no errors, a precompiled header will be stored in the same folder as the project file.  Its name will be the same as the source file with the suffix removed (MyProjectHeaders.cpp => MyProjectHeaders).  Precompiledheader files may reside anywhere in the project tree or system tree, althoughproject-specific precompiled headers will most likely go in the project tree.Finally, you can remove the source file for the precompiled header from yourproject.¥ TidbitsYou can drag and drop text in windows by using the right mouse button.cmd-opt-s is save all windows.  cmd-opt-w is close all windows.If you can compile but not link try renaming boot/be/Tools/mwld to bld.=====================Contacting Metrowerks=====================For bug reports, technical questions and suggestions, please use the formsin the Release Notes folder on the CD, and send them to support@metrowerks.comBug reports for the IDE should also be sent to stern@metrowerks.com. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------Metrowerks Corporation
