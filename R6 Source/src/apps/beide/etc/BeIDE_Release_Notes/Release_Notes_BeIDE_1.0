Metrowerks BeIDE Release Notes 
=============================================

Version:	1.0
Date:		8/21/96
Authors:	Brian Stern, Jon Watte, Mark Anderson
=============================================

Greetings Be developers.  This release of BeIDE is for 
BeOS DR8.  It includes new command line tools, including
a disassemble tool, and many new features.

Some of the default options for mwcc have changed.  See the tools
documents for more info.

============================
New Features
============================

¥	New appearance for the Settings window - scrolling list of the prefs
	panels.

¥	Target prefs panel - This panel allows you to associate various kinds
	of files with tools so that those tools will process the files during
	the make process.  Each line in the target list specifies a file type
	and/or file extension, a stage of make, whether the file can contain
	resources, and the name of a tool.
	
	When a file is added to a project its file type and extension are used 
	to associate it with a target.  The file's type and extension are 
	compared to the list of targets.  If a target has both a file type 
	and an extension both must match exactly.  If a target has no 
	file type then it matches all file types and if it has no extension 
	then it matches all extensions.  For example there is a target 
	for .rsrc files that has no file type and an extension of rsrc.  
	Any file with the extension 'rsrc' will match this target, 
	regardless of file type.
	
	There are four stages of Make: precompile, compile, link, and postlink.
	These are represented by the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively in
	the target list, and can be specifies for any target by using the 
	'Flags' popup menu.  If a target runs at the precompile stage it 
	will be executed by its target tool before all files that run 
	at later stages.  Files are started executing from top to bottom 
	in the project window.  If a target has the 'Ignored by Make' flag 
	set then it will not contribute in any way to the make process. 
	This allows files like .doc and .h files to be added to a project 
	for easy access.
	
	The 'has resources' flag indicates that these files may contain 
	resources that should be copied to the executable.  This happens 
	during the postlink stage.
	
	The toolname is of course the tool that processes the file at the
	specified make stage.
	
	You may add new targets to the target list or change the ones that are
	present.  For example if you wanted all files with the extension 'cpp'
	to be compiled by mwcc regardless of their file type you could remove
	the file type from that target record.
	
	¥Important¥ BeIDE doesn't copy resources in the way that it has in 
	previous versions.  For a project to have its resources copied to 
	the executable,  files of extension 'rsrc' must be added to the project.
	Your applications won't get their appi or icons if you don't add
	your .rsrc files to the project.
	
	In this release of BeIDE the only tools that are supported by the
	targetting mechanism are mwcc and mwld.  In the next release there
	will be support for other command line tools.  

¥	Find Definition - If you option-double click on a function name or
	file scope static variable name, the definition of the function or 
	variable will be selected.  The information for this feature is 
	generated when files are compiled, it is stored in the project file,
	and it is removed when the Remove Objects menu item is chosen.
	
	You may also initiate this search from the 'Find Definition' window
	which appears when Find Definition is chosen from the Search Menu.
	Holding down the shift key when choosing the Search menu will change 
	Find Definition to Go Back.  Go Back will return the selection
	to the location current when the last Find Definition was initiated.

¥	Tile, Stack, Vertical Tile - These menu items reorder source windows
	in the current workspace.

¥	Info Panel in Message window - Three icons appear at the top of the
	Message window.  Clicking in the checkboxes next to these icons
	will show or hide the errors, warnings, or info messages.
 
¥	Compilation progress checkmark - A checkmark appears next to
	a source file that is being compiled.  The checkmark appears when
	the file starts compiling and disappears when the file completes
	compiling.  For those of you familiar with the Mac IDE this behavior
	is different from how the checkmark behaves in the Mac IDE project
	window.
	
¥	Option key held down at launch - Holding down the option key
	while BeIDE is launching will reset all database entries to
	factory defaults.  This includes all settings made in the Settings
	Window as well as settings for the Find and Message windows.  It
	does not include font settings for individual source files.
	 
¥	Command option '-' - Command '-' is Remove objects.  Remove objects
	deletes all .o files and deletes the browse data used for the
	Find definition feature.  Command option '-' also deletes all
	of the include file dependency info for each source file.

¥	All commands that are described here or in the documentation
	that use the option key will also work with the left control
	key (cmd-opt-S, cmd-opt-w, option-double-click and others).

¥	When creating a new project libdll.a and libbe.so are 
	automatically added to the project. 

¥	Can now print text documents.

¥	Check syntax and disassemble commands for source files.  Check syntax
	checks for compile errors but doesn't produce an object file.  You can
	check syntax on a file that isn't part of the currently open project,
	but a project must be open.  Dissasemble displays a disassembled
	version of the source file in a second window.  see the new 
	'PPC Disassembler' prefs panel for options in the display of the
	disassembly.

¥	Recent projects menu item - Shows a list of projects opened since
	BeIDE was launched.  Choose one to open it.  

¥	The project format has changed for this release.  When an old project
	is opened it is automatically converted to the new format.  The new
	format is not backwards compatible with previous formats.  In addition
	several changes are automatically made to old projects.  The RTTI
	and Exceptions options are turned on.  These should be turned on for
	C++ projects and won't affect C projects.    Any files called libpos.so 
	are changed to libbe.so.  The library file libpos.so no longer exists
	and the functions that were in that file are now found in libbe.so.

¥	New projects now have libbe.so and libdll.a added to them.

==========================
Bugs Fixed in This Version
==========================

Fixed a bug related to guarding of include directories with parentheses.
Fixed a bug related to tabs and truetype fonts in source windows.
Fixed a bug related to failing to save and restore the selection 
when closing and reopening source files.
Fixed a bug where files opened before a project was opened couldn't
be added to the project.
Fixed a possible deadlock with the Find window.
Fixed a bug when doing batch finds with files not in newline format.

==========================
Random Notes
==========================

Be has compiled libbe.so with RTTI on and exceptions on.  You will want
to turn on RTTI and most likely exceptions as well in the Language
prefs panel.  Look at ClassInfo.h for more info.

The format of the project file has changed in this release and is not
backwards compatible with previous releases.  When you open a project
for the first time it will be automatically converted.  For large projects
this may take some seconds.

==========================
Known Limitations
==========================

Sometimes when dragging a file into the project window the cursor doesn't
reappear after the file is dropped.  If you click the mouse somewhere
in the project window or other windows it will reapper.
Don't save the targets prefs panel for a project while it is compiling.
Support for tools other than mwcc and mwld in the target prefs panel
isn't complete.
