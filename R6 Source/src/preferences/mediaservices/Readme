This program will display a dialog that allows you to configure whether your 
system uses the new or old media services when it boots.  Changes made here 
will be applied to your bootscripts, and will take effect the next time you 
boot your system.

In general, it is best to use the new media services.  However, if you are
having problems some older programs, reverting to the old media services may
fix them.  Note that you can always switch back to the previous configuration 
by re-running this program.
