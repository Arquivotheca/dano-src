Metrowerks BeIDE Release Notes 
=============================================

Version:	1.4b2
Date:		9/30/97
Authors:	Brian Stern, Jon Watte, Fred Peterson,
			Burton T. E. Miller, Bernie Estavillo 
=============================================

Howdy Be developers.  This is an update to BeIDE in
preparation for a netborne update that will appear in
the next couple of months.

This update has changed the way that the plugin api works in part.
You will need to use new versions of the MWPrefsPlugin and 
MWJavaPlugin.  Existing third party plugins should still
work, as well as the existing MWBResPlugin and ShellPlugin.

============================
New Features
============================

*	The prefs panels in the Settings window are now only shown if they work with
	the currently chosen target (linker).  So you won't see the Java prefs panels
	when the target is C/C++ and the reverse.
	
*	The Project prefs panel now only applies to C/C++ projects and won't be visible
	for Java projects.  There is a new Java Project prefs panel that will apply
	to Java projects.

*	You can now launch Java applets from the IDE (without hassle).

*	The concurrent compiles popup has moved from the Project prefs panel
	to a new 'Build extras' panel.


1.4b1
*	Text selection with and RGB color.  You may now specify any RGB color
	to be used as the hilite color.  The UI for setting this color is, um,
	primitive at the moment.  When you run this version of BeIDE for the
	first time it will create a file called /boot/home/config/settings/hilite_color.
	This file contains an ascii text rgb color used as the hilite color.
	You may edit the color in any text editor.  The file is read once when BeIDE
	starts up.  You may wish to use the palette in IconWorld to determine
	a hilite color that you like.  The hilite_color file can have more than one
	color in it or other text; only the first color is read.  Following is what my
	file looks like:
	
51,203,255,0		//light blue
217,217,217,0		// default grey


*	Configurable Key bindings - You can now set the key bindings for
all menu items and editor commands.  

To do this open the Settings window
and go to the KeyBindings pane.  Inspect the list for the menu item or
editor command you are interested in.  Double-click the line of interest and
the change bindings window will appear.  You may enter up to two bindings for
each command, choose between them by clicking on the primary or alternate
box.  Hold down the new key binding, hit the Apply button, and hit the save
button in the Settings window.

For example say you would like the Settings window to appear when you
hit F7.  Open the Change key bindings window for the Settings menu command.
Enter F7 as the primary binding.  Hit Apply, and save the changes in the
Settings window.

You may have multi-key bindings by use of prefix keys.  Open the Change Binding
window for one of the prefix keys.  Enter a keybinding, say control-X, and hit apply.
You may then enter key combinations like 'control-X, control-S' in the change binding
window for menu commands.  The prefix timeout field is the time in 60ths of a second
beyond which a prefix key combo is no longer valid.  For example the default
prefix timeout is 120 (2 seconds).  If you hit control-X, pause three seconds, then
hit control-S, the prefix key will not be valid for that keydown.  If control-S is a valic
key binding then it will be used.  If the pause was less than 2 seconds the control-X, 
control-S key binding would be accepted.

The quote key makes the subsequent key combination be ignored.  For example the 
key combination option-G generates the UTF-8 character for the copyright symbol, Â©.
If you wanted to use option-G as a key binding in and wanted to type the copyright
symbol into a text window you would use the quote key.  If the quote key binding
is control-`, you would enter control-`, option-G, and the copyright symbol
will be correctly entered.  The prefix key timeout also applies for the quote key.

The editor commands only apply in text windows.  So changing the key binding for
move to previous line to something else than the default up arrow won't affect
the use of up arrow in the project window or message window or Settings window.

BTW, a handful of the menu commands can change their text depending on which modifier
keys are held down (like save and save all with the option key and shift changes all
the search menu items).  Unfortunately you need to have the modifier key down
before the menu is chosen.  So hold down shift and look at the Search menu or hold
down option and look at the File menu.


Limitations -

Can't set key bindings for the Add-ons menu yet.

Certain key bindings won't display correctly in the menu.  Especially
those that use special keys like F1, pageup etc.  Also, prefix key bindings
won't display correctly in the menu.  These key bindings should all work though.

Certain key bindings can't be entered in the Change Bindings window.  These are
primarily bindings with many modifier keys.

Several of the key bindings listed in the settings window aren't implemented.  These
include all the editor commands related to sub-words and the Redo menu item.  Redo
uses the same key binding as Undo for now.

*	Support for file permissions for text documents.  If you open a text document that
	has its unix file permissions set to read-only BeIDE won't let you edit this file.

*	Added a checkbox for Generate Profiling Info to the PPC Processor prefs panel.
	Use this to tell the compiler that you are profiling this application.  You also
	need to add libprof.a to the project and call PROFILE_INIT() and PROFILE_DUMP()
	in your app.


==========================
Bugs Fixed
==========================

Fixed a problem that made it difficult to enter new key bindings into
the change bindings window.
Fixed a problem where removing a key binding didn't remove it from
open windows.
Fixed a problem where you could add a duplicate key binding if it
was the alternate key binding.

If you continue to see any problems with the key bindings please report
them, even if you already reported them.


1.4b1
Fixed a crashing bug when printing.

Fixed a problem when updating dr8 project files.

Fixed a crashing bug that appeared after opening a certain number
of project files.
