** Using the net_endpoint_node and httpd.js with the chromatic UI **
   2001-06-21 dsandler

This node is not in the build by default, and not referenced
in the binder by default either.  It is required for httpd.js
(the JavaScript web server in the chromatic UI).

Add the following to your boot/home/config/settings/binder/root
beneath the /service level:

	<object name="net_endpoint" handler="net_endpoint_node"/>
	
Also, add the net_endpoint_node (built from this directory) to
/system/add-ons/binder/.

Try it out!  httpd.js should auto-sense that the net_endpoint_node
is available, and start a server on port 81.
