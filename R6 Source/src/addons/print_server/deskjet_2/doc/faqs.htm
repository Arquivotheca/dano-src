  <p>Any Hewlett-Packard DeskJet printers not listed in the Printing document's <a href="printing.htm#Printer Family / Functionality Table">Printers
  Family / Functionality Table</a> should be considered <i>not</i> supported.
  Specifically, printers in the 400 and 700 DeskJet families are not
  supported. Printers introduced to the market <i>after</i> the latest SDK
  release should also<i> </i>be considered not supported. Naturally, printers
  that are not Hewlett-Packard printers, or are not Hewlett-Packard DeskJet

  also not supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="P&amp;F3">How do I know which printers I want?</a></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If code size is not a factor, Hewlett-Packard recommends developers utilize
  the monolithic SDK code set which implements all SDK-supported DeskJet printers. However,
  if code size is a factor, developers should choose a printer that takes into account
  the host system hardware environment and end-user requirements. If your host
  system has USB, be sure to choose a printer that has USB capabilities.
  Conceptualize your customers' printing requirements including
  color and image quality. Determine the price your customers will be willing to
  pay for a printer. Refer to the <a href="printing.htm#Printer Family / Functionality Table">Printers
  Family / Functionality Table</a> to determine which
  printers meet the needs of your host system and your end users.</p>

not all features that come with a specific printer are included in the SDK code,

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="P&amp;F4">How come I can't use all the features that come with my printer?</a></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>While this SDK code does contain space-optimized versions of many of the
  same factors as full-featured HP windows drivers, not all printer features
  c75ould be included and still meet the small footprint required by many non-pc
  host systems. Hewlett-Packard has slim-lined this driver to meet all the needs
  of standard printing functions, while foregoing printer &quot;options&quot;
  not included with all printers.</p>

<p><b><a name="DF&amp;H2">What is Raster data as it relates to printing?</a></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Images are represented digitally as two-dimensional grids of colored dots
  or <b>pixels</b>. Each pixel is represented by some combination of color
  values. The representational pixel format accepted by the SDK code is <b>RGB</b>,
  meaning one byte (a value from 0 to 255) for the red component, followed by
  one byte (again, a value from 0 to 255) for the green component and one byte
  for the blue component -- thus 3 bytes represent a pixel in RGB format.
  Example: a shade of green could be written as (00,00,11).</p>
  <p>A <b>raster</b> is a single row of pixels. If there are N pixels in a row,
  then one unit of <b>raster data </b>is 3*N bytes, starting with 3 bytes for
  the leftmost pixel, 3 for the next pixel, and so on. (Refer to the <a href="glossary.htm">Glossary</a>

for each printer, such as sample timing diagrams and optional capabilities such
as ECP and RLE compression. Where can I find them?</a></b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hewlett-Packard DeskJets conform to the 1284 IEEE Specifications. We do everything that is
mandatory to meet the 1284 IEEE Specifications, and do not violate any of the
timing specs. As such, we do not have any additional diagrams or documentation. We <i>do</i> support ECP
and compatibility mode for the forward direction, and
nibble mode for the reverse direction. (In Hewlett-Packard terms, forward means
from host system to printer; Reverse means from printer to host system.) We <i>do not</i> support RLE.&nbsp;(See <a href="glossary.htm#e">Glossary</a>
for further explanations of these terms.)&nbsp; </p>
<p> Sample
timing diagrams are in the 1284 IEEE Specifications. For example, nibble mode is
on page 32 of the 1284 IEEE Specification. </p>

<p><b><a name="DF&amp;H1">We dont have a USB port on our device and are
instead using a parallel port to connect to the printer. Which of the IEEE-1284
modes do we need to support? Also, how is printer status returned back from the
printer? For example, how do you report an out of paper condition?</a></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The current version of the driver assumes that 1284 Compatibility mode is
  used to send all data to the printer, (even though for some printers in the
  future ECP/forward mode may be used for better performance). Status
  information is returned from the printer in two different ways. Limited status
  information (Out of paper, Paper jam,) is obtained via the parallel port
  status byte while in compatibility mode. At times, the printer driver will
  poll the printer for additional status information via the 1284 Device ID
  string (for issues such as top cover open, pen identification, wrong or
  missing pens, etc.)&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A 1284 Device ID string is typically returned to a host using nibble mode.
  When the printer driver requests the device ID string, the system should in
  turn query the printer for it so that the printer driver can parse the string
  for various information. If a printer exception occurs, (such as out of paper)
  the printer driver will call the DisplayPrinterStatus API with the
  corresponding error code so that the system can display the appropriate
  message and allow the user to take the necessary action.</p>
  <b>
  <p>The following is not required but is strongly encouraged for 1284 support:</p>
  </b>
  <p>When connecting to many of the newer / faster printers (even some low-end
  models), ECP/forward mode may be necessary in order to achieve reasonable
  print speeds. (This is because data throughput is much higher in this mode
  than in Compatibility mode.) Even if the device does not ship with this
  capability enabled, it should at least be software upgradeable at some point
  in the future. In the future when ECP/forward mode may be an option, the
  system will need to be able to toggle in and out of Compatibility, ECP/forward
  and Nibble/reverse modes (at the direction of a future printer driver). That
  will allow status and pacing information to be obtained using the existing
  mechanisms. Since these mode transitions will be occurring throughout the
  print job, it is important that these transitions be as efficient as possible
  in order to minimize overhead.</p>

<p><b><a name="CWHP3">How do I submit my print output script files for review and when will I hear back?</a></b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Printed output in the form of script files can be
  submitted via email on the <a href="http://www.hp-developer-solutions.com/members/programinfo/assistance.cfm">SPP
  Program Assistance Web Page</a>. To submit the script files, log on to the <a href="http://www.hp-developer-solutions.com/">SPP
website</a>  (http://www.hp-developer-solutions.com/) using your assigned login
name and password, and send an email titled &quot;Script Files&quot;, with the
attached script files. Be sure to include your name, email and phone number in
the email, should Hewlett-Packard need to make direct contact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an effort to control costs associated with this program, Hewlett-Packard
may not be able to test or debug every script file submitted for review.
(Hewlett-Packard charges no fees for the SDK or associated costs such as script
file review, in an effort to keep this product available to as many developers
and platforms as possible.) Developers are still strongly encouraged to submit
their script files, and Hewlett-Packard will make every effort to review them.
Developers will be notified within five (5) business days as to whether or not
Hewlett-Packard will be able to review and return their script files.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
