Metrowerks BeIDE Release Notes 
=============================================

Version:	1.5
Date:		2/20/98
Authors:	Brian Stern, Fred Peterson,
			Burton T. E. Miller, Bernie Estavillo,
			Ed Swartz
=============================================

Howdy Be developers.  This is an update for the BeIDE on PPC
and the introduction of BeIDE for x86.

The names of mwcc and mwld have been changed to mwccppc and 
mwldppc.  This is to facilitate moving projects between
BeOS-ppc and BeOS-x86.  The entries in the Targets prefs
panel will all be updated to the new names when opening
existing projects.

Read the release notes for the compiler and linker.  The last
compiler version was 1.8 and the current version is 2.0.1.

============================
New Features
============================

*	Stationery files.  Choosing New Project brings up a window that allows you
	to choose from several stationery projects.  You then can choose the name
	for and where the new project will be installed.  The template stationery
	projects live in the 'stationery' folder.  When you create a new project
	in this way the entire contents of the chosen stationery project's folder
	is copied to the new folder, including subfolders and links.  You can
	easily add new stationery projects to this folder or make changes
	in the existing stationary projects to suit your needs.

*	Right click on a file in the project window brings up a context-sensitive
	menu that allows compiling the file, viewing the file's path, and other
	useful things.

*	Added a warning message for files that don't have a maching target in the 
	Target prefs panel.  Such files are ignored during builds, which may not
	be what you want.  This warning will appear when a project is opened and
	if changes are made to the targets prefs panels.
	
*	Global optimization prefs panel for both x86 and ppc compiler.


==========================
Bugs Fixed
==========================

Fixed a bug where the last entry in the Settings window was missing sometimes.


==========================
Known Limitations
==========================

There is an incompatibility with this compiler
and some of the headers from the standard C++ library that
ships on PR2.  Some of those headers won't compile with this new
compiler.  To fix this requires an update to MSL, and this
will come later.  For the moment, if you are using those headers
and they won't compile you are out of luck and need to stick with
the existing 1.8 compiler.
