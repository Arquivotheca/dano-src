Metrowerks BeIDE Release Notes 
=============================================

Version:	d4a
Date:		7/8/96
Author:		Brian Stern, Jon Watte, Mark Anderson
=============================================

Greetings Be developers.  This interim release of BeIDE for BeOS 1.1d7.1 
has several new features and includes new command line tools.

============================
New Features in This Version
============================

¥	Find Definition - If you option-double click on a function name or
	file scope static variable name, the definition of the function or 
	variable will be selected.  The information for this feature is 
	generated when files are compiled; it is stored in the project file;
	and it is removed when the Remove Objects menu item is chosen.
	
	You may also initiate this search from the 'Find Definition' window
	which appears when Find Definition is chosen from the Search Menu.
	Holding down the shift key when choosing the Search menu will change 
	Find Definition to Go Back.  Go Back will return the selection
	to the location current when the last Find Definition was initiated.

¥	Tile, Stack, Vertical Tile - These menu items reorder source windows
	in the current workspace.

¥	Info Panel in Message window - Three icons appear at the top of the
	Message window.  Clicking in the checkboxes next to these icons
	will show or hide the errors, warnings, or info messages.
 
¥	Compilation progress checkmark - A blue checkmark appears next to
	a source file that is being compiled.  The checkmark appears when
	the file starts compiling and disappears when the file completes
	compiling.  For those of you familiar with the Mac IDE this behavior
	is different from how the checkmark behaves in the Mac IDE project
	window.
	
¥	Option key held down at launch - Holding down the option key
	while BeIDE is launching will reset all database entries to
	factory defaults.  This includes all settings made in the Settings
	Window as well as settings for the Find and Message windows.  It
	does not include font settings for individual source files.
	 
¥	Command option '-' - Command '-' is Remove objects.  Remove objects
	deletes all .o files and deletes the browse data used for the
	Find definition feature.  Command option '-' also deletes all
	of the include file dependency info for each source file.


==========================
Bugs Fixed in This Version
