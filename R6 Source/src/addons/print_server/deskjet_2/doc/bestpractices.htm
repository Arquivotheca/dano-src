<h1 align="center">Best Practices for Optimal Printing</h1>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><font color="#000080">Introduction</font></h2>
<p>It is easy to make the mistake of assuming that the image on the screen
will automatically transfer to the printed page, printing an identical image as
to what is on the screen. It does not.. This ‘screen shot’ approach
will not achieve the look and feel that a user expects when holding printed
output in his/her hand, and comparing that same information to what is on
the TV screen.</p>
<p>The main differences between a video display (TV/monitor) and a printout of
that display, are in image resolution levels and formatting for correct text size and
color.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font COLOR="#000080"><a name="Problem">Problem</a>: Image/Text Resolution</font></h2>
<p>A higher resolution image (more pixels per inch) means a higher quality
image. Therefore it is not surprising that when image data is compressed (such as
compressing a multi-megabyte bitmap image down to a 125k JPEG image,) some
amount of data (i.e. quality) loss occurs in the process. In other words, higher compression
leads to a greater quality degradation. On the opposite end of the spectrum, low
resolution compressed images may look fine on a video screen at 72 dpi, but
will not look very good after they have been scaled back up to the 300 dpi
requirements of the printer. The images will be blocky – a curved line for
instance will not be smooth but instead have a stair-step appearance. Text
appears to suffer more than images because smaller objects rely more on the
precision of high resolution, and while a low resolution image may simply have
poor print quality, low resolution text may become unreadable.</p>
<h2><font COLOR="#000080">Best Practice:</font>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Use the highest quality images available when printing. The ability to
deliver this depends on the capabilities of the host system, but the same image used
by the display does not have to be the same one used for printing. For example, the
server for an internet device may compress image data to improve
download speed. The device itself may receive the image data and ‘down-sample’
the image even further, essentially throwing away data to fit the 72 dpi screen. In this case, it would be desirable to re-request the
uncompressed version of this image when formatting for the higher resolution
printed page. Go back to the original image data and ask that the
page be re-formatted for printing, rather
than simply passing off the 72 dpi screen page to the printer driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For text, if the device simply has a set of stored raster fonts optimized for
screen resolution, the developer should make use of the printer’s
high-resolution built-in fonts. (Refer to <a href="devicebasedfont.htm">Device
Based Fonts</a> for more information.) Alternately, if the device has a font
rendering engine, the text for the printed page should be re-rendered through
the font engine at the higher resolution when formatting the page for printing.
Text rendered at 72 dpi screen quality and then passed to the printer driver
will produce the same poor quality as stored 72 dpi raster fonts. The font engine is
a powerful tool – take advantage of it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font COLOR="#000080">Problem: Formatting and Layout for the Screen vs. the
Printer</font></h2>
<p>Reading text on a television screen from across the room or even from an LCD
screen attached to the phone is different from reading text on the printed
page. Passing a ‘page’ of data optimized for the phone or television screen
directly to the printer will produce a printed page which is WYSIWYG (&quot;<u>W</u>hat
<u>Y</u>ou <u>S</u>ee <u>I</u>s <u>W</u>hat <u>Y</u>ou <u>G</u>et,) <i>but not
what the user expects</i>. The news article the user prints from his/her
favorite on-line news service should not be 5 pages of BIG text if that same
article would have taken one page in the local newspaper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font COLOR="#000080">Best Practice:</font>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Normal text should be about 10 to 12 points in size and take advantage of the
full paper size. A system with a 40 character LCD display may now have
twice that width in which to format the information. A TV/internet browser will
now have much more text displayed on a page. As such, care must be taken to wrap
text correctly around images. Actually, smaller text allows more precise placement
and should wrap more easily around other objects.</p>
<p>Be sure to take into account page and text colors. The printed
page by default is <i>white.</i> But light colored text on a black background
is common for TV based systems as it reduces noise and is generally easier to
read. Laying down all the black ink on the printed page to reproduce this effect
will certainly irritate the user who is waiting for all that ink to dry, and who
must now go out and buy a new ink cartridge after printing relatively few print jobs.
Take note of the change in background and text when choosing text color. White
text will obviously not show up on a white background and even yellow text will
be extremely difficult to read. Choose text colors that will contrast
appropriately with the background. The system may make it an option to print
backgrounds, as some web pages are designed such that the background image is an
integral part of the page. If this option is chosen, we suggest the logic exists
to not re-map the text color. (Mapping white text to black while printing a dark
background would lead to the same problem of printing white text on the white
page.)&nbsp;</p>
<p> One final word of warning, if the ability to print page backgrounds is
allowed, it should not be the default. Most backgrounds are extraneous to the
information the user is printing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font COLOR="#000080">Problem: Clipping to the Printed Page</font></h2>
<p>A web page is usually formatted as one long page with text and graphics
intermingled as appropriate. The printed page unfortunately has
physical limits to its width and length. It is entirely possible and probable that while printing
multi-page documents, text or images could be cut in half between pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font COLOR="#000080">Best Practice:</font>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Do the best you can. No easy set of rules exists to solve this problem in all
scenarios. Be aware of how much space remains on the current page. The printable
width and height of the page are available via the PrintContext object.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s a simple calculation to give you the input height (number of your
rasters) that will fit on a printed page:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
InputHeight = PrintHeight/ (PrintWidth/InputWidth)</p>
<p>(PrintWidth/InputWidth) gives the scaling factor for the page. This value is then
divided into the PrintHeight to supply the number of input rows.
Tracking the number of rasters you’ve imaged to a given location will allow you to
correspondingly track the amount of space remaining on the page.</p>
<p>Implement a &quot;look-ahead&quot; region so that text that would normally be clipped is moved to the next page. Images can be treated the same way, though
certainly some images may have to be clipped in order to maintain proper
formatting. A very long image for instance, would require clipping, but smaller
images may be ‘nudged one way or the other to be kept intact. Certainly text is the
easier and more critical of the objects to not have clipped.</p>
