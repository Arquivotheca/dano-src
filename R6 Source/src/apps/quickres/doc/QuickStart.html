<h1>QuickRes Resource Editor</h1>

<p>QuickRes is an application for editing BeOS resource files.
It allows direct editing of data in standard binary resources
(BResources), attributes, and a new resource source file format.</p>

<h2>Main Features</H3>

<ul>
<li> Save and load files in both binary (.rsrc) and source
     (.rdef) format.
<li> A new resource definition format that natively understands
     common Be data types, including BMessage.
<li> Edit both attributes and resources.
<li> In-place viewing and editing of resource data, as well as
     full-window editors.
<li> Add-on architecture for resource editors (a toolkit for
     implementing your own add-ons is included).
<li> Currently includes editors for:
     <ul>
     <li> Raw data (hex editor)
     <li> Integers and floating point numbers.
     <li> BRect
     <li> BPoint
     <li> rgb_color
     <li> Application flags
     <li> Strings
     <li> Bitmaps
     <li> Icons
     <li> Cursors
     </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>You can start viewing resources right away -- just start up QuickRes,
select "Open..." and select the "Binary.rsrc" example file.  You will
immediately see a list of all resources (and attributes) in the file.
The columns tell you, in order:</p>

<ol>
<li> Bullet if an individual item has changed from what was last saved.
<li> Type: The type code of this resource item.  Standard type codes will
     be shown if you pull down the "New" list.
<li> ID: The resource ID of the item.  If the item is not an actual
     resource, this column will be (attr) for an attribute or (data)
     for the body of the a file.
<li> Name: The name of this resource item.
<li> Data: If available, an in-place editor and viewer for this item's
     actual data.
<li> Size: The number of bytes in this item's data.
</ol>

<p>To edit a resource item, you have two choices.  Some data types can
be edited in-place -- for example, click on one of the resources of
type MIMS to select it, and select the Edit/Edit In Place menu.
You will see rectangles appear around the type, ID, name, and data fields,
allowing you to edit them right in the list.</p>

<p>All editors support out-of-line editing.  To use this, select the
desired item and then the Edit/Edit In Window menu.  A window will pop
up with a full editor for the item.  The exact editor will depend on
the type of data you have selected -- there are currently editors for
bitmap images, strings, basic data types, and a hex editor for all other
types.</p>

<h2>Creating Your Own Resources</h2>

<p>To create your own resource file, select File/New.  A blank resource
list will appear, into which you can start adding resources.  New resources
can be created in a number of ways:</p>

<ul>
<li> Select the Edit/New Item menu, and start selecting types and adding
     resources through the window that appears.
<li> Click on the "New" popup menu in the top-left corner of the main
     window, and select the type you would like to have.  If a resource
     is currently selected, the newly created resource will have an ID
     after the selected resource.
<li> Drop files on to the resource list.  QuickRes will create a new
     resource with the data from that file.  You may need to then set
     the new resource's type to see and edit it.  For example, if you
     drop a text file on the list, you will need to change its type
     to CSTR.  (But note, however, that doing this will cause a \0
     terminator to be appended to the end of the resource data.)
</ul>

<h2>Resource File Formats</h2>

<p>In addition to the traditional binary resource format, QuickRes supports
a new resource source file format.  When you create a new resource list,
it will be stored by default in binary form -- you can change the format
when you save the file by checking the desired format in the "Format"
menu is the save dialog.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: For now, it is recommended that you stay with the binary
file format.  The source format's syntax may change.</strong>  See a
description of the <a href="Grammar.html">Resource Definition Language</a>
for more information.</p>

<p>A third format offered by QuickRes is for attributes.  This is used for editing
the attributes of a file that is not a resource binary or definition file.  In
this mode, you can also edit the file's main data as if it were a single resource
item.  For example, you can open an existing PNG image into QuickRes and edit
the image using QuickRes' bitmap editor.</p>

<h2>Important Limitations</h2>

<ul>
<li> QuickRes is designed to edit individual resources items of
     moderate size -- if you have a 650KB picture in your resources,
     editing this in the bitmap editor will be painful at best.  For
     these kinds of resources, it is best to edit them in some other
     editor and drop the final result into your resource file.
<li> While the bitmap editor allows you to edit bitmaps of any format
     for which there is a translator, many of these do not behave as
     well as one would like.  Your best bet is to stick to archived
     bitmaps and PNG images when you want to edit an image with the
     bitmap editor.  Any format works fine for simple viewing, however.
<li> When editing attributes, nothing is done to make sure that you don't
     have attributes with the same name.  Be sure to avoid duplicate names,
     or you will lose those attributes when they are saved.
