=============================================

Greetings Be developers.  This is an update of the BeIDE release
versions found on the DR3 CodeWarrior for Be CD and the AA BEOS CD.
It has few new features.  It does have a number of bug 
fixes and performance improvements over the releases on
our CD and the BeOS CD.


============================
New Features
============================

*	Faster opening and saving of projects.

*	Faster searching for files.
		  
*	Includes MWBResPlugin, which didn't make it onto the CD.

*	Stampsound plays in the about box.


==========================
Bugs Fixed
==========================

Some deadlocks on the windowlist semaphore have been fixed.  This problem
was noticed mostly on PowerMac and PowerComputing machines (i.e., uniprocessor
machines).  If you see this again please let us know and send a ps.

Fixed a problem with use of command-arrow keys in text windows.

Fixed a typo with the default paths {beide}/headers/libraries -> {beide}/libraries.

Fixed a bug where changes in the Linker prefs panels were ignored until the project
was closed and reopened.

Fixed a bug that caused 'duplicate code' link warnings for .h files in a project.

Fixed a crash seen after adding about a hundred files to a project.

Improved the mechanism for setting the icons for executables.  You should just
need to add a rsrc file to your project that has the correct resources built
by IconWorld and FileTypes.  If you change the contents of any of these resources
(icons, supported types, etc.) you should delete the executable and rebuild it 
from scratch.

==========================
Known Limitations
==========================

The Printing menu items have been disabled.

Recursive searching doesn't work correctly if there are circular links in recursive
access paths.
